### Hi there 👋

I am a PhD Student in [Health Data Science](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/study/cdt) at Oxford 🎓.
Right now, I am finishing the taught part of my degree.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on connecting the UK Biobank activity data with potential health outcomes as part of the data challenge.
- 🔭🔭 In a few weeks I will start exploring the applications of **Computer Vision** 💻👀 to medical imaging, in particular, to early lung-cancer diagnosis.
- 🌱 Separately from my PhD program, I’m currently learning cool **NLP** 💻💬 techniques taught by the [Deep Learning School](https://www.dlschool.org/advanced-track) from [MIPT](https://mipt.ru/english/). The course is only taught in Russian 🇷🇺.

Here are some of the best free online courses which can boost your ML/DL knowledge 🚀 My plan is to get through all of them at some point. I'll skip the repetitive parts ⏰
- English 🇬🇧
  - [Deep Learning](https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/) from [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/admissions.html) by [Yann LeCun](https://twitter.com/ylecun) and [Alfredo Canziani](https://twitter.com/alfcnz) (next on the list ⏭️)
  - [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) from [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu)
  - [CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) from [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu)

- Russian 🇷🇺
    - [Deep Learning (part 1)](https://stepik.org/course/91157/promo) similar to CS231n (completed ✅)
    - [Deep Learning (part 2)](https://stepik.org/course/92488/syllabus) similar to CS224n (in progress :hourglass:)
