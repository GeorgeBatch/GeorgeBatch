### Hi there 👋

I am a PhD Student in [Health Data Science at Oxford](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/study/cdt)
funded by [Professor Fergus Gleeson](https://www.oncology.ox.ac.uk/team/fergus-gleeson).
I am focusing on applications of **Computer Vision** 👀💻  and **NLP** 💬💻  to medical imaging,
in particular, to early lung-cancer diagnosis.

- 🎓 Previously, I studied [Mathematics and Statistics at Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/mathsstatsbsc) for my Bacholors and did my [Masters in Statistics at Oxford](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/study-here/taught-postgraduate/msc-in-statistical-science/).
- 🌱 Separately from my PhD program, I’m currently learning cool **NLP** 💬💻 techniques ([repository](https://github.com/GeorgeBatch/nlp_from_dls)) taught by the [Deep Learning School](https://www.dlschool.org/advanced-track) from [MIPT](https://mipt.ru/english/). The course is only taught in Russian 🇷🇺.

Here are some of the best free online resources to boost your ML/DL knowledge 🚀 I am currently doing it, while skipping the repetitive parts ⏰

- English 🇬🇧
  - [Deep Learning](https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/) from [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/admissions.html) by [Yann LeCun](https://twitter.com/ylecun) and [Alfredo Canziani](https://twitter.com/alfcnz) (next on my list ⏭️)
  - [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) from [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu)
  - [CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) from [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu)

- Russian 🇷🇺
    - [Deep Learning (part 1)](https://stepik.org/course/91157/syllabus) 👀  similar to CS231n ✅ - [repository](https://github.com/GeorgeBatch/cv_from_dls)
    - [Deep Learning (part 2)](https://stepik.org/course/92488/syllabus) 💬  similar to CS224n ⏳ - [repository](https://github.com/GeorgeBatch/nlp_from_dls)
